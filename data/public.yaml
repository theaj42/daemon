about:
  name: "A.J. Van Beest"

  tagline: "Builder. Explorer. Improver of things."

  bio: |
    I'm someone who improves things—not out of perfectionism, but because
    refinement is how I engage with the world. Whether sailing, cooking,
    playing music, or building systems, I'm always asking: how can this be better?

    I value precision in language and beauty in expression. I'm drawn to harder
    paths because they're more interesting. I make decisions intuitively, then
    find data to support what I already know.

    Professionally, I work in security and automation. Personally, I'm a sailor,
    a musician (sax), a father, a partner, and someone trying to balance
    holding the ground for my people while still finding adventure.

identity:
  core_statement: |
    I'm loyal and seek loyalty in return. I'm energized by groups but find my
    deepest connections with individuals traveling similar paths—people who can
    dive into serious intellectual exploration and then go play in the dirt together.

  missions:
    - "Hold the ground for my people so they can pursue their dreams"
    - "Engage fully with the natural world through adventure"
    - "Build authentic, honest, joyful connections with family, friends, and community"

  values:
    - "Social justice"
    - "Equality"
    - "Wilderness"
    - "Environmentalism"
    - "Artisanry"
    - "Competence"

  beliefs:
    - "People are more important than money, corporations, computers, pretty much everything else"
    - "Sometimes the only way through is through—fear can be a marker of growth"
    - "We define 'success' for ourselves"
    - "It's okay to take a break. What's important is that I begin again"
    - "Physical adventure is a gateway to deeper understanding of ourselves"
    - "Personal AI systems should augment natural workflows, not replace them"

adventures:
  sailing:
    current_boat: "Merit (Drascombe Lugger)"

    philosophy: |
      Sailing provides enforced presence—temporary relief from the optimization
      mindset. Solitude, physical reality, mastery pursuit, and enforced unplugging.

  exploration:
    - "France—exploring places we might like to live"
    - "Wilderness time (consistently needed, often deferred)"
    - "Taking harder paths because they're more interesting"

  music:
    instrument: "Saxophone (dormant 8+ years, recovering)"
    status: "Goal: recover sax and start playing again"
