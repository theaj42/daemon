Whether sailing, cooking,\nplaying music, or building systems, I'm always asking: how can this be better?\n\nI value precision in language and beauty in expression. I'm drawn to harder\npaths because they're more interesting. I make decisions intuitively, then\nfind data to support what I already know.\n\nProfessionally, I work in security and automation. Personally, I'm a sailor,\na musician (sax), a father, a partner, and someone trying to balance\nholding the ground for my people while still finding adventure.\n",
